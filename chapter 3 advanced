questions:
The management of JustLee Books has approved implementing a new commission policy and  benefits plan for the account managers. The following changes need to be made to the existing  database:  
• Two new columns must be added to the ACCTMANAGER table: one to indicate  the commission classification assigned to each employee and another to  contain each employee’s benefits code. The commission classification column  should be able to store integers up to a maximum value of 99 and be named  Comm_id. The value of the Comm_id column should be set to a value of 10  automatically if no value is provided when a row is added. The benefits code  column should also accommodate integer values up to a maximum of 99 and  be named Ben_id. 
• A new table, COMMRATE, must be created to store the commission rate schedule  and must contain the following columns:  
 • Comm_id: A numeric column similar to the one added to the  ACCTMANAGER table  
 • Comm_rank: A character field that can store a rank name allowing up to 15  characters  
 • Rate: A numeric field that can store two decimal digits (such as .01 or .03)  
• A new table, BENEFITS, must be created to store the available benefit plan  options and must contain the following columns:  
 • Ben_id: A numeric column similar to the one added to the ACCTMANAGER table  
 • Ben_plan: A character field that can store a single character value  
 • Ben_provider: A numeric field that can store a three-digit integer  
 • Active: A character field that can hold a value of Y or N  Required: Create the SQL statements to address the changes needed to support the new  commission and benefits data.
